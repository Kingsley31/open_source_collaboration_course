<p> <h1><mark>making fun out of the weekend</mark></h1>
    The weekend is most commonly considered the period between Friday evening and the end of Sunday. More strictly speaking, the weekend is thought to consist of Saturday 
    and Sunday (often regardless of whether the calendar week is considered to begin on Sunday or Monday).

    In practical terms, the weekend is typically considered to be the period between the end of the workweek (or school week) and the beginning of a new one—which is why 
    most people consider their weekend to start on Friday night, after work or school.
    Weekends spells that time that most people disconnect from busy schedules and unending office hours. 
    It’s the time when you can do something that you love and one that excites.
     However, it’s easy to find yourself lapsing to a predictable routine that you’ve followed your entire life. 
    It could be because of budget constraints, or you aren’t creative on some of the exciting things you can do during the weekend.
     You would be surprised to realize that whether you prefer to spend your weekends alone or with a few friends there are so many activities you can try out.

     <h1><mark>pursue your passion</mark></h1>

Most of the time, we are occupied by our careers and spend nearly our entire lives working. We barely have time to reflect on our passions. 
Doing something you love can be the best thing for both your mental and physical health. 
Pursuing your passion can turn into the love of that activity, and you can begin doing it during the weekend. 
It would be best if you never were afraid to create time to do something important or fun.
 Whatever it is, give it a try, and it will make your life much happier.

 <h1><mark>Go out for wildlife</mark></h1>

During the weekend you’ll get a lot of free time, so why not head to the nearest local park? 
It is very refreshing and exciting to watch wildlife without the stresses of work lingering in your head. 
If you find the park fees a little off your budget, you can go to the countryside and enjoy seeing nature in action. 
The best thing about this activity is that you can do it solo or with a few friends.

<h1><mark>Catch a bottle</mark></h1>

Weekends cant be emphasised without reiterating the better impacts of taking a bottle of chilled heineken or budweiser as the case maybe.
Irrespective of the games one would prefer to choose at the weekend,their is every tendency that there is a third companion which is the beer bottle.
Most of the times, we go out on weekends to cool off and put a break to the stressful schedules; their is a doormant euphoria that spikes up at the very comfortable level
This euphoria is mostly modified and brought to full life when one gets inebriated or responsively is giving to alcohol.
