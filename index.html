        <h1>functionality of time</h1>
        <p>Time is one big concept that has to do with the occurence and reference..It is measured or measurable period during which an action, process, or condition exists or continues 
            Time is a <mark>border<span>line</span></mark> between history and concurrent happenings..
            Time feels like an essential and defining feature of human life, yet, when pressed to define it, we inevitably fall back upon duration, change, and ultimately, the tenses of our languages, past, present, and future. 
            We all have a direct experience of time, or so we think, and yet it is the dimension of our lives about which there is the greatest philosophical and cosmological disagreement. 
            Aristotle cut to the quick in his Physics (Book IV, ch. or part 10): “First, does it belong to the class of things that exist or to that of things that do not exist? Then secondly, what is its nature?” 
            Is time real, in other words, or is it some kind of figment of the human imagination? 
            Is time absolute, as Newton proposed, or relative, as Einstein argued?

            Even though it’s something that’s all around us and most of us take it for granted, time is one of the most mysterious forces in the universe.
            Time is a paradoxical mystery. For example, the present moment is both infinitely short and infinitely long, at the same time! 
            To resolve this mystery, Bernardo Kastrup argues that time and space are not objective scaffoldings of the external world, but rather an internal cognitive interface that we use to interact with a purely mental, atemporal reality.
            That is, we create time and space within ourselves to better organise the information we collect about the world.

            Nonetheless, if we try to pin down the present moment by saying ‘now!’, by the time we begin to open our mouth it has already vanished into the past. 
            Like a blob of mercury that slips through our fingers every time we try to grab it, we can’t ever catch the present moment, even though we are—paradoxically—always in it. 
            The present moment is both inescapable and elusive, intangibly short; a vanishingly narrow slit forever squeezed in between the monstrousness of a receding past and an approaching future, both of which the present moment… well, contains! 
            So we end up having to admit that, at the limit, everything—i.e., 
            the whole of time—exists in the vanishing nothing of the present moment.
